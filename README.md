### Prerequisites
- Python 
- Django 
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Music_Player.git

2.**Navigate to the project directory:**

    music_player_using_django_finetune

3.**Create a virtual environment:**
  
    python -m venv myenv

4.**Activate the virtual environment:**
  - Windows:
    
        myenv\Scripts\activate
    
  -Linux/MacOS:
  
    source myenv/bin/activate
    
5.**Install dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt



6.**Run the development server:**
 
    python manage.py runserver


# Note: 
- If you encounter an error while installing **cchardet** , it might be due to issues with building the package on certain Python versions. If this happens, consider using a different Python version or look for alternatives to cchardet.

- If you continue to face issues, you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. You can download it from here. After installation, try running the installation command again.


**Steps to Resolve:**

**1. Ensure Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools Are Installed**
**Download and Install:**

   Visit the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools and ensure you've installed the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

**Verify Installation:**

   Open the Visual Studio Installer, select "Modify" on your existing installation, and ensure "Desktop development with C++" is checked.


**2. Open the Developer Command Prompt**

Use the Correct Command Prompt:
Open the "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio" (you can search for this in the Start menu).
This command prompt automatically sets up the environment variables required for the Visual C++ tools, including cl.
**3. Check the Compiler**

******In the Developer Command Prompt:******

    cl

    
Type cl and press Enter.
If everything is set up correctly, you should see version information for the Microsoft C++ compiler.


**4. Activate Your Virtual Environment in the Developer Command Prompt**

- Navigate to Your Project Directory:
  - Use cd to change to your project directory.

        cd D:<your_path>
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
